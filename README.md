# MacroX

Assistance application for Bee Swarm Simulator.
<br>
<br>
There are a few things about the application ("MacroX") you should now:
- This was made after the release of Byfron's Hyperion and most functions are deemed safe.
- You should not use this application alongside other macros which may negatively interact with inputs.
- This application is updated frequently therefore we suggest using our loadstring.

I am not an advanced scripter so please suggest ways I can improve.
