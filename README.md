# MacroX

MacroX is an advanced and sophisticated assistance application for Bee Swarm Simulator.
<br>
<br>
<br>
MacroX Features:
- Tool and token collection
- Pollen conversion (hive/micro-converters)
- Gathering of flames, bubbles, fuzzy bombs and precise crosshairs.
- Auto dispensation (sll)
- Supports "Toys" interactions (eg Wealth Clock) (Beesmas available)
- Planter management
- Auto Sticker Stack and Sticker Printer
- Collect boosters then later farm in the boosted field
- Advanced webhook system and reports for Discord
<br>

MacroX need-to-know:
- This was made after the release of Byfron's Hyperion and most functions are deemed safe.
- You should not use this application alongside other macros which may negatively interact with inputs.
- This application is updated frequently therefore we suggest using our loadstring.
- If ran on an Emulator, it will be laggier than usual because of the device's streaming capabilities.

I am not an advanced scripter so please suggest improvements.
