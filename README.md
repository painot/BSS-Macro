# MacroX

MacroX is an advanced and sophisticated assistance application for Bee Swarm Simulator.
<br>
This application in no way changes the DataModel of any game and only interacts with it at a safe level.
<br>
It's recommeded to use the custom presets to suppress BSS anti-cheat flag-ups.
<br>
There is no way you will get banned in-game from using this.
<br>
A detected executor will cook you and lead you to your downfall, use a trusted one.

MacroX need-to-know:
- You should not use this application alongside other macros which may negatively interact with inputs.
- This application is updated frequently therefore we suggest using our loadstring.
- We support emulators however they may be a lot laggier compared to actual devices.
